<P class="p2 ft5">Security</P>
<P class="p31 ft3">We employ procedural and technical safeguards to secure your personal information against loss, theft, alteration, and unauthorized access, use and disclosure. We also employ security procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.</P>
<P class="p32 ft3">Regardless of the precautions taken by Railroad, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure.

<P class="p20 ft5">Children and Privacy</P>
<P class="p38 ft3">We do not knowingly permit users to register for our Service if they are under 13 years old, and therefore do not request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 13 who has provided personally identifiable information to us without your approval, please inform us by contacting us at the <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> address below and we will remove such information from our database.</P>
