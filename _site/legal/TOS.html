<P class="p6 ft0">CONTENT SHARED THROUGH THE SERVICE</P>
<P class="p39 ft3">The Service may make it possible for you to choose to share certain information with the public or other users of the Service. There are a number of ways in which you can control how much information is shared, and Railroad will make efforts to comply with your instructions from the options provided to you by Railroad.

This Agreement does not convey title or ownership to you, but instead gives you only the limited rights set forth herein.</P>
<P class="p40 ft0">ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF SERVICES</P>
<P class="p43 ft3">Railroad reserves the right to deny all or some portion of the Service to any user, in Railroad’s sole discretion, at any time.</P>

<P class="p34 ft0">DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</P>
<P class="p48 ft6">YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. RAILROAD, ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, ACCURACY, SUITABILITY, APPLICABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON- INFRINGEMENT OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN) OBTAINED BY YOU FROM RAILROAD SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.</P>
<P class="p49 ft6">USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. RAILROAD DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING; THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR <NOBR>ERROR-FREE;</NOBR> THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; THAT DATA TRANSMISSION OR STORAGE IS SECURE OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF INACCURACIES, MISREPRESENTATIONS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL INFORMATION OR COMPONENTS.</P>
<P class="p50 ft6">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RAILROAD OR ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIER (COLLECTIVELY, THE “RELATED PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU BASED ON OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF RAILROAD AND/OR RELATED PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>
<P class="p51 ft6">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a court shall find that the above disclaimers are not enforced, then you agree that neither Railroad nor any of the Related Parties shall be liable for (1) any damages in excess of $500.00 or (2) any indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages or loss of use, lost revenue, lost profits or data to you or any third party from your use of the Service. This limitation shall apply regardless of the basis of your claim or whether or not the limited remedies provided herein fail of their essential purpose.</P>
<P class="p52 ft3">This limitation shall not apply to any damage that Railroad causes you intentionally and knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in this Agreement.</P>
<P class="p4 ft0">INDEMNIFICATION</P>
<P class="p53 ft3">You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Railroad and its suppliers, subsidiaries, licensors, and licensees, and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, members, employees and agents harmless from all allegations, judgments, awards, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including but not limited to</P>



<P class="p55 ft3">reasonable attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and costs of litigation arising out of or based on (a) Submissions or Content you submit, post to or transmit through the Service, (b) your use of the Service,</P>
<P class="p55 ft3">(c) your violation of the Agreement, and (d) any conduct, activity or action which is unlawful or illegal under any state, federal or common law, or is violative of the rights of any individual or entity, engaged in, caused by, or facilitated in any way through the use of Service.</P>
<P class="p40 ft0">DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</P>
<P class="p55 ft3">You agree that any claim or dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Service or any service provided by Railroad, will be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The laws of the State of New York shall govern this Agreement, and shall be used in any arbitration proceeding.</P>
<P class="p56 ft3">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.</P>
<P class="p57 ft3">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the following address: 1830 Meridian Ave., Apt. 704 Miami Beach, FL 33139.</P>
<P class="p58 ft3">Arbitration under this Agreement will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules then in effect. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.</P>
<P class="p59 ft3">You and Railroad agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both you and Railroad agree that parties have each waived any right to a jury trial.</P>
<P class="p57 ft3">Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that Railroad may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property or other proprietary rights.</P>
<P class="p58 ft3">To the extent arbitration does not apply, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services, or to Railroad, may only be brought by you in a state or federal court located in New York, New York. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS VENUE AS INCONVENIENT OR INAPPROPRIATE, AND AGREE TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN NEW YORK.</P>
<P class="p1 ft0">POLICIES FOR CHILDREN</P>
<P class="p55 ft3">The Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. You must be over the age of 13 to use the Service. In the event that Railroad discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, we will make efforts to delete the child’s information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Please see the Federal Trade Commission's website (www.ftc.gov) for more information.</P>
<P class="p49 ft3">Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. More information on the availability of such software can be found through publicly available sources. You may wish to contact your Internet Service Provider for more information.</P>
<P class="p40 ft0">GENERAL</P>
<P class="p60 ft3"><SPAN class="ft1">Severability</SPAN>. If any provision of this Agreement is found for any reason to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be given its maximum enforceable effect, or shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.</P>



<P class="p62 ft3"><SPAN class="ft1">No Partnership</SPAN>. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Railroad as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Service.</P>
<P class="p63 ft9"><SPAN class="ft15">Assignment</SPAN>. Railroad may assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without Railroad’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.</P>
<P class="p5 ft9"><SPAN class="ft15">Attorneys’ Fees</SPAN>. In the event any litigation is brought by Railroad in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</P>
<P class="p64 ft9"><SPAN class="ft15">No Waiver</SPAN>. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</P>
<P class="p65 ft3"><SPAN class="ft1">Notices</SPAN>. All notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to: legal@getontracks.com.</P>
<P class="p66 ft9"><SPAN class="ft15">Equitable Remedies</SPAN>. You hereby agree that Railroad would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.</P>
<P class="p67 ft3"><SPAN class="ft1">Entire Agreement</SPAN>. This Agreement, including the documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Railroad with respect to the Service, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral or written.</P>
