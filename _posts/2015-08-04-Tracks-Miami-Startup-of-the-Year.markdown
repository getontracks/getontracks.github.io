We're lucky to have been voted Miami's best startup. Thank you to [tech.co] for the award! 


From Tech.co:

The Tech Cocktail event crew was thrilled to help WeWork open their new Miami location, right in the heart of Lincoln Rd in South Beach. The atmosphere at last Thursday’s event was just as fun as the scene outside! The volunteer community in Miami is strong, and we’d like to thank all of the volunteers who helped make this event possible, along with our sponsors: WeWork – Lincoln Road, Carve Communications, Ford, Advaion, American Airlines, and CEA.

13 fantastic Miami startups got to pitch their products to the local community: from health care to sports apps, Miami startups really do show up! The winners from Thursday night qualify for the semifinals at Celebrate 2015 in Las Vegas!
