**From the Knight Foundation:**  
A crowd estimated at 170 people had a chance to explore the products up close and ask questions of the principals of the 13 competing startups, which were set up expo-style at WeWork, the new co-working space in Miami Beach. They then heard short-and-to-the-point pitches from each startup. The event was part of a 10-month-long series of regional startup competitions and mixers, hosted by Tech.co.

Other stops for the Startup of the Year Competition and Mixer have included Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco and New York, and the tour will continue in Chicago (Aug. 20), Southeastern Virginia (Aug. 27) and Washington, D.C. (Sept. 9). The selection process includes both online startup competitions and regional pitch events. Tech.co readers and live audiences then vote for their favorite startups. Thursday, those in attendance selected Liveanswer.com, while the online audience chose Tracks.
