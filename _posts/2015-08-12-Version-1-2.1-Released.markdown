**Updates updates, get your updates!**   

- Quick Capture! Now tapping the plus button starts recording instantly
- Swipe to edit. Simply slide contacts to the left to edit names, leave conversations, and exit the demo track once youâ€™ve seen it a few times :wink:
- Remember that failed recording bug? Neither do we. We must have left it behind. 
- Have an idea for the app? Submit feedback in Settings
- If you were a Tracks user, what would your name be? Answer coming soon.
