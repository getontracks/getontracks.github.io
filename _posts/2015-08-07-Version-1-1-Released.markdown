**Updates updates, get your updates!**   

- Videos are now sending at record speeds
- "Is that supposed to happen?" We fixed some crashes and bugs (but left a few in because it builds character)
- "What if I’ve got nothing to say?" Swipe down on the responding screen to close a conversation
- Need to send something quick, but have a video waiting from your friend? Tap the plus icon and send a Fast Track to record without watching their video first
- Getting lost in the Tracks time-warp? Tap the screen while watching to see when a video was sent
- What else? Nifty animations and updated interface
