						<h2>Ok, some more legitimate questions:</h2>
						<p class="p-question">How do I know when a video is sent?</p>
						<p class="p-answer">Tracks sends videos as soon as you stop recording your response. The indicators to the right of the recipient's name will tell you how long ago the last video was sent.</p>
						<p class="p-question">How do I end a conversation?</p>
						<p class="p-answer">You can always swipe down on the responding screen to send only the reaction portion of your video. Your friend will then be able to see your reaction, and chose whether to keep the conversation rolling, or swipe down as well to close the conversation. Pick up where you left off whenever you like by taping their name!</p>
						<p class="p-question">What if I don’t have wifi or a data connection?</p>
						<p class="p-answer">If your wifi or data connection is not strong enough to transfer the video, it is stored on your device until you regain connection. Stored videos are sent as soon as connection is restored.</p>
						<p class="p-question">Does Tracks store my videos after I watch them? </p>
						<p class="p-answer">No. Your private videos can only be watched once, and are deleted from our servers as soon as they are watched. The only videos we can watch are the ones you send to Team Tracks.</p>
						<p class="p-question">How do I block a user or flag content?</p>
						<p class="p-answer">If you wish to report, block or flag objectionable content or users, you can do so in a number of ways. First off, you can go to settings>manage contacts and then tap a name and block a user. You can also flag content or block a user using our feedback form in the settings section. We will act on objectionable content and user reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content.<br><br>
							You may also email <a class="underline" href="mailto:legal@getrailroad.com">legal@getontracks.com</a>, which is in the terms of service; or you may send a video to us, “Team Tracks” (our open line of communication with users), with comments or reports. Via any of these methods we will act on objectionable content and user reports within 24 hours.</p>
							<p class="p-question">What is the End User License Agreement?</p>
							<p class="p-answer">An End User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal contract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that application. We use Apple’s standard EULA documentation. You can view the agreement here: <a class="underline" href="http://getontracks.com/legal/EULA.html">http://getontracks.com/legal/EULA.html</a></p>
