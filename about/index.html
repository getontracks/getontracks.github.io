            <p>
              Tracks makes video messaging more like talking face-to-face. By capturing your authentic reaction and response each time you open a video, Tracks enables continuous, face-to-face conversationsâ€”on your time.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Tracks began as an idea on a napkin (actually, though). After a few months working nights and weekends, cofounders Evan, Rey, and Seth, began full time in spring 2015. Now Tracks is an angel-backed team of five, working from Miami Beach, Florida.
